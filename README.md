# Decimal32

A Swift implementation based on the Intel Corp Decimal Floating-Point Math 
Library v2.2. This library uses Binary Integer Decimal (BID) encoded numbers 
in its implementation. Conversions to/from Densely Packed Decimal (DPD) 
encoded numbers are provided.

**NOTE**
Not complete. Decimal32 has been tested and is working.  Decimal64 and Decimal128 still need testing and work.
